This folder contains self-sufficient Matlab code to demonstrate the H3D dataset and detection using poselets.
For H3D demo please run demo_annotation_tools.m
For poselet demo please run demo_poselets.

(You may need to rebuild mex_imresize inside poselet_detection directory for your platform)

The code achieves AP of 46.41 on PASCAL VOC 2007 (47.02 with the old PASCAL AP measurement algorithm)

The code is distributed with non-commercial license. Please see the associated license file.
